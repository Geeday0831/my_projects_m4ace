Hi my name is Abdulrauf Abdulwahab
I am an backend Intern in the M4ACE program.
I am really glad i got into the program because i was once a student under full-stack development but i missed out on the backend part. i am only good with the frontend whivh i still practice it alot.

but with this opportunity i am sure i would make most of it and get back on track for my Full-stack development. 
Thank you.
